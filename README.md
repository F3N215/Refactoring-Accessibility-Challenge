# On-the-Job Ticket // Refactoring & Accessibility for a Marketing Agency

## Project Summary 
* This project was a prime example of working with existing code to refactor and update an existing page to match accessibility criteria. Working with digital marketing agency Horieson, I was tasked with assessing and updating code on Horieson's website assigned by my tech lead.
* By working to improve the HTML code without changing how it functions, and keeping the overall page within 90% of its likeness, I worked to ensure that Horieson's website adheres to accessibility criteria to ensure people with disabilities can still capably use the site.

## Summary of Changes
* Revised previous tags to follow proper Semantic HTML guidelines.
* Added accessible alt attributes to images on the site.
* Added new title, and revised headings into chronological order (ie. h1 -> h6) based on the importance of information therein.
* Adherence to the **Scout Rule** - consolidated CSS selectors and properties labeled with comments for a cleaner, more organized flow.
