## Project Summary 📋
* This project was a prime example of working with existing code to refactor and update an existing page to match accessibility criteria. Working with Horieson, a full-service digital marketing agency, I was tasked with assessing and updating code on Horieson's website assigned by my tech lead.
* By working to improve the HTML code without changing how it functions, and keeping the overall page within 90% of its likeness, I worked to ensure that Horieson's website adheres to accessibility criteria to ensure people with disabilities can still capably use the site.

## Summary of Changes 📝
* Revised previous tags to follow proper Semantic HTML guidelines.
* Added accessible alt attributes to images on the site.
* Added new title, and revised headings into chronological order (ie. h1 -> h6) based on the importance of information therein.
*  **Scout Rule** Adherence: consolidated CSS selectors and properties for a cleaner, more organized flow.
*  Comments added to CSS consolidation for faster navigation
